## 1. Product Vision & Philosophy

District-level weather bulletins tell you it will rain *"somewhere over Pune district"*. They do not tell a farmer in Maval or Baramati, growing soybean or cotton during sowing season, what action to take this week. 

That gap — between generic forecasts and actionable farm decisions — is where devastating crop losses happen:
- Sowing prematurely on a single misleading pre-monsoon shower.
- Running an expensive irrigation pump hours before heavy torrential rain.
- Unnoticed dry spells until root moisture is depleted and crops are irreversibly stressed.

**VarshaMitra's Core Principle:**
$$\text{PREDICT} \longrightarrow \text{VISUALIZE} \longrightarrow \text{DECIDE} \longrightarrow \text{ACT}$$

Every view provides a direct, actionable answer to a farmer's real question in their language (**English** or **मराठी**):
1. **What is likely to happen?** — Hyperlocal rainfall forecast & climate indicators (Open-Meteo High-Resolution Ensemble).
2. **What does it mean for my farm?** — Hyperlocal climate risk assessment & geospatial map across all 36 Maharashtra districts.
3. **What does it mean for my crop?** — Soil profile compatibility & MPKV Rahuri / PDKV Akola sowing readiness across 24 crops.
4. **What should I do right now?** — Actionable agronomic advisory with DO and AVOID guidance.
5. **How can I ask follow-up questions?** — Saarthi AI companion with persistent conversation history powered by NuGen Intelligence.

## 2. Statewide Maharashtra Coverage & Location Resolution

VarshaMitra supports **any location across all of Maharashtra** (36 districts, ~160 talukas, arbitrary villages, towns, PIN codes, and GPS farm coordinates):

- **Search by Place or Village**: Instant search covering all 36 districts and talukas (e.g., Alibaug, Panvel, Chiplun, Baramati, Niphad, Shirur).
- **Search by 6-digit Indian PIN Code**: Resolves postal locations (e.g., `410206`, `413102`) to administrative boundaries and coordinates.
- **Direct Map Click Selection**: Click anywhere within Maharashtra's geographic boundaries ($15.60^\circ\text{N} - 22.15^\circ\text{N}$, $72.60^\circ\text{E} - 80.90^\circ\text{E}$) to resolve and evaluate that farm location.
- **Device GPS Geolocation**: Single-click "Use My Farm Location (GPS)" using HTML5 browser geolocation.
- **Hybrid Geocoding Architecture**:
  1. Authoritative in-memory Maharashtra gazetteer (36 districts, ~160 talukas) for instant zero-latency resolution.
  2. OpenStreetMap Nominatim engine bounded to Maharashtra with rate limiting (1 req/sec) and a 2-hour TTL cache.
  3. Dynamic backend location registration (`geo_{lat}_{lon}`) ensuring all downstream weather, risk, and advisory APIs immediately resolve without 404s.

## 3. Technology Stack

### Frontend (`/src`)
- **Next.js 16.3.4 (App Router)** with React 19 and TypeScript.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** featuring an agricultural design system:
  - Deep Forest Green (`#1b3b2b`) for primary actions and navigation.
  - Monsoon Blue (`#1e5f74`) for rainfall intelligence.
  - Warm cream background (`#fbfbfa`) and restrained earthy accents.
- **MapLibre GL** risk maps default to a clean thematic choropleth, with road and satellite basemaps available as alternatives. They share backend-derived `/api/v1/risk/summary` data and `/api/v1/risk/boundaries` polygons. Taluka boundaries use the geoBoundaries India ADM3 (2018) release, sourced from the Local Government Directory and distributed under ODbL 1.0. Climate values remain approximate area-reference estimates, not farm-level measurements; polygons receive a risk color only when their name, district, and reference coordinate match a monitored area. The map shows taluka-level categories, not fine-grained raster hotspots.
- **Recharts** for rainfall probability bands and temperature series.
- **Lucide React** for iconography.
- **Bilingual i18n**: English and Marathi (`mr`) language support across all routes.

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **FastAPI (Python 3.12)** with Pydantic v2 schemas and strict typing.
- **Meteorological Provider**: Open-Meteo High-Resolution Weather API & Multi-Decadal Historical Archive.
- **Agronomic Rules Engine**: Package of Practices from Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth (MPKV), Rahuri and Dr. PDKV, Akola.
- **Regional Soil Intelligence**: Agroclimatic soil baseline mapping (Vertisols / Black Cotton Soils vs. Coastal Laterites / Inceptisols).
- **NuGen AI Grounded Explanations & Saarthi Chat Companion**: Conversational assistant with persistent SQLite conversation history and explainability layer grounded in deterministic meteorological and agronomic evidence.
- **Local Persistence**: SQLite database storing multi-decadal historical climate series, dynamic geocoded locations, and Saarthi conversations.

Boundary data can be regenerated with `python scripts/build_risk_map_boundaries.py` from the repository root. The script downloads the pinned geoBoundaries release and emits the Maharashtra-only source file under `backend/app/data`.

## 4. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (Node 20+ recommended)
- Python 3.10+ (Python 3.12 recommended)
- Git

### Step 1: Start the FastAPI Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Linux / macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
Backend API will be active at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.  
Interactive OpenAPI documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Verified market prices
To show Agmarknet prices, set `DATA_GOV_IN_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` using a key issued by Data.gov.in, then restart the backend. The API only displays official records matching the selected crop and district. Without a key, the farmer dashboard shows static crop-specific demo prices alongside the selected district; these are clearly labeled as examples and must not be treated as today's market rates. If the official API is configured but has no matching records, no demo or other-district price is substituted. The dashboard links to [Agmarknet](https://agmarknet.gov.in/) for reference.

Farmer sign-in and registration are currently a local demo stored on the device. SMS OTP and biometric authentication are not enabled; do not use the demo with sensitive personal information or on a shared device.

### Farmer feedback and WhatsApp community
Farmer feedback is saved by the backend in its SQLite database and shown publicly. Sample posts in the portal are explicitly labeled as examples, not real testimonials. The feedback form does not ask for phone numbers and rejects phone-number-like text. The WhatsApp group invite is configured in `src/config/community.ts`; group membership and phone-number visibility are controlled by WhatsApp, not VarshaMitra.

### Step 2: Start the Next.js Frontend
In a separate terminal from repository root:
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 5. Verification & Testing

Every layer of VarshaMitra includes automated verification suites:

```bash
# 1. Run Backend Pytest Suite (Unit, indicators, agronomy, geocoding)
pytest backend/tests -v

# 2. Run Frontend API Client Tests
npm run test:api

# 3. Run Live Integration Suite (verifies frontend connected to backend)
npm run test:integration

# 4. Lint Check
npm run lint

# 5. Production Build
npm run build
```

## 7. Data Provenance & Disclosures

- **Weather & Rainfall Forecasts**: Open-Meteo High-Resolution Ensemble Model.
- **Historical Observations**: Open-Meteo Historical Archive / ERA5-Land reanalysis.
- **Crop Rules & Sowing Calendars**: Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth (MPKV), Rahuri and Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV), Akola.
- **Soil Baseline Data**: ICAR-NBSS&LUP agroclimatic soil classification. Regional Vertisol / Laterite baseline models are clearly identified as modeled estimates.
- **Administrative Coordinates**: Centroids and geocoded points are geographic references; they do not represent surveyed cadastral farm boundaries.
- **Map layer availability**: The map summary reports which layers are actually available. Forecast and historical rainfall are fetched for a selected area; regional forecast/history aggregation, crop-distribution map data, and farmer-report feeds are not currently provided by the map API. Missing layers are shown as unavailable, not inferred.
